\subsection{Design and operation of the second generation of interferometric gravitational wave detectors}\label{subsec:2ndgen}

%Beside generally aiming at a factor 10 overall improvement in sensitivity, and an expansion fo the sensitive frequency band towards lower frequencies, the design of the advanced detectors was aimed at making them limited by thermal noise, laser radiation pressure and laser shot noise. As a consequence, all other possible sources of noise needed to be pushed well below these main ones.

\subsubsection{Advanced LIGO}

\paragraph*{Suspesions and seismic isolation.}
Two of the subsystem that underwent the biggest upgrades in advanced LIGO as compared to its predecessor were the Seismic Isolation and Suspension subsystems. Although they are formally two separate subsystems, they work in concert to isolate the test-masses and other critical optics from ground vibrations and other macroscopic motions, and ensure that the they can move as free masses in the relevant degree of freedom above a few Hz.

In Advanced LIGO, the test masses are suspended by four-stages pendula. From top to bottom, the main suspension chain is comprised of two metal masses, and two optics of the same shape and size, the lowermost one being the test mass. The first metal mass is attached to the suspension structure by four \textit{spring blades}, which are flexible metal blades providing vertical isolation; steel wires run from the tip of the blades to the suspended mass. In a similar fashion, the second metal mass is attached to the first one, and so is the topmost optic. In the lower stage of the suspension, however, the test mass is attached to the topmost optic by four fused silica fibers; these are directly welded to the two optics in a monolithic assembly, such as to reduce mechanical losses and, consequently, thermal noise. The pendulum resonances of the four stages are distributed between 1 and 4 Hz, providing a passive suppression of motion along the optical axis of $10^-7$ at 10\.Hz, and going down as the frequency to the eighth power.

A similar chain of masses, called reaction chain, hangs parallel to the main one, and supports the sensors and actuators used for local damping and active alignment of the lowermost three masses of the main chain; this provides a quiet reference point for the control forces. The top masses of both chains are instead actuated using the suspension structure as a reference. For all stages except the lowest, the sensors/actuators are compact units that uses shadow sensors to measure the position of, and electromagnets to exert forces on, permanent magnets attached to the masses. The last stage has no local sensors, since the position of the test mass is sensed by the global interferometry; the actuators consist of a patterns of electrodes deposited on the last mass of the reaction chain, which exert electrostatic attractive forces on the test mass when polarized. This avoids the need of attaching magnet or any other part ot the TM, thus maintaining low mechanical losses and reducing possible couplings to external fields.

Each quad suspension is attached to an in-vacuum seismic isolation platforms, used for further suppression of ground vibrations and precise positioning and alignment with a larger range than allowed by the suspensions themselves. The platforms are six-axis, two-stages active and passive isolators proving more than 3 orders of magnitude isolation above 1\.Hz, and positioning capabilities with nm resolution over a range of several mm.

Similar seismic isolation platforms are used to support all the in-vacuum optics; the optics that are part of an optical cavity are installed by triple-pendula, while single-pendulum suspensions, or specialized geometries, are used to isolate less critical optics where necessary.

In both detectors, each of the in-vacuum seismic isolation platforms is installed on beams that are decoupled from the vacuum system itself via flexible bellows, and supported from the outside using hydraulic actuated piers anchored to ground. This systems acts as a further layer of isolation and is used to correct macroscopic positioning correction like the one needed to correct for the moon tidal forces.

%Four 1-m long silica fibers, two per side, connect the test mass to an optic of the same size and shape above it. The fibers are directly welded to both optics in a monolithic assembly to reduce dissipation and consequently thermal noise. The upper optic is then suspended by four steel wires that attach to the tip of as many \textit{blade springs}, flexible metal blades providing vertical isolation. The blade springs are anchored to a metal mass, which is in turn attached to the suspension structure by another four wires and four blade springs.

\paragraph*{Laser}
At freqeuncies above about ??? Hz, the interferometer sensitivity is limited by shot noise in the laser. The relative impact of the shot noise scales as the inverse of the sqare root of the power: increasing the laser power is thus a conceptually straightforward way of improving the sensitivity in the shot-noise limited band. The Advanced LIGO laser source is designed to deliver a maximum of 180\.W of laser power, as opposed to the 35\.W used in eLIGO. To obtain this, a the eLIGO laser unit is coupled to an high power laser amplifier (say more about this). The beam is per-stabilized in power, using a reference photodiode, and in frequency, using a thermally controlled refernece optical vacity, before being handed off to the Input Optic subsystem.

\paragraph*{Thermal compensation system}
Despite the stringent requirement on the optical absorption of bulk and coating material of the optics, the high power levels circulating in the interferometer result in a non-negligible amount of heat released into the optics. Due to the poor heat conduction in vacuum, this induces important thermal gradients that can modify the optical parameters of the system via two main effects: thermal lensing in the bulk material, due to the temperature dependence of the index of refraction on  and surface distortion.

Optical layout (Paul)

\begin{itemize}
\item stable recycling cavities
\item larger beam sizes on TMs, configuration with a small waist
\item arm length stabilization
\item OMC
\item input optics?
\end{itemize}

interferometric sensing and control (Paul)

\begin{itemize}
\item length sensing and control, PDH
\item sideband frequencies, resonances in certain cavities
\item Schnupp asymmetry
\item DC offset
\item ESDs
\item ASC
\end{itemize}

signal recycling. I actually think this should maybe just go under optical layout.
Maybe also have a section for noise budget, or sensitivity curve?








Aside from the addition of the signal recycling mirror, the most notable change from the initial LIGO optical 
layout is the stable design of the recycling cavities.
