\subsection{Design and operation of the second generation of interferometric gravitational wave detectors}\label{subsec:2ndgen}

\subsubsection{Advanced LIGO}
\begin{itemize}
\item Sesmic isolation upgrade (Giac)
\item optical layout (Paul)
\item Laser power upgrade (Giac)
\item sensing and control (Paul)
\item Thermal compensation (Giac)
\item signal recycling (Paul)
\end{itemize}

Optical layout (Paul)

\begin{itemize}
\item stable recycling cavities
\item larger beam sizes on TMs, configuration with a small waist
\item arm length stabilization
\item OMC
\item input optics?
\end{itemize}

interferometric sensing and control (Paul)

\begin{itemize}
\item length sensing and control, PDH
\item sideband frequencies, resonances in certain cavities
\item Schnupp asymmetry
\item DC offset
\item ESDs
\item ASC
\end{itemize}

signal recycling. I actually think this should maybe just go under optical layout.
Maybe also have a section for noise budget, or sensitivity curve?








Aside from the addition of the signal recycling mirror, the most notable change from the initial LIGO optical 
layout is the stable design of the recycling cavities.


\subsubsection{Advanced Virgo}
\begin{itemize}
\item Sesmic isolation upgrade?
\item Laser power upgrade
\item Optical layout
\item sensing and control
\item Thermal compensation
\item signal recyling
\end{itemize}
