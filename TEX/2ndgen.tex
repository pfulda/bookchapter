\subsection{Design and operation of the second generation of interferometric gravitational wave detectors}\label{subsec:2ndgen}

Even while the initial LIGO and Virgo detectors were still far from their design sensitivities, plans were afoot for major 
upgrades to each, aimed at achieving roughly a factor 10 improvement in sensitivity over the whole frequency band. 
This generation of detectors would be known as the 2nd generation, or the advanced detectors; Advanced LIGO and 
Advanced Virgo. 

Besides generally aiming at a factor 10 overall improvement in sensitivity, and an expansion of the sensitive 
frequency band towards lower frequencies, the design of the advanced detectors was aimed at making them 
limited by thermal noise, laser radiation pressure and laser shot noise. As a consequence, all other possible 
sources of noise needed to be pushed well below these main ones.

\subsubsection{Advanced LIGO}

\paragraph*{Suspensions and seismic isolation.}
Two of the subsystems that underwent the biggest upgrades in Advanced LIGO as compared 
to its predecessor were the Seismic Isolation and Suspension subsystems. Although they 
are formally two separate subsystems, they work in concert to isolate the test-masses and 
other critical optics from ground vibrations and other macroscopic motions, and ensure 
that the they can move as free masses in the relevant degree of freedom above a few Hz.

In Advanced LIGO, the test masses are suspended by four-stage pendula. From top to 
bottom, the main suspension chain is composed of two metal masses, and two optics 
of the same shape and size, the lowermost one being the test mass. The first metal mass 
is attached to the suspension structure by four \textit{spring blades}, which are flexible 
metal blades providing vertical isolation; steel wires run from the tip of the blades to the 
suspended mass. In a similar fashion, the second metal mass is attached to the first one, 
and so is the topmost optic. In the lower stage of the suspension, however, the test mass 
is attached to the topmost optic by four fused silica fibers; these are directly welded to 
the two optics in a monolithic assembly, such as to reduce mechanical losses and, 
consequently, thermal noise. The pendulum resonances of the four stages are 
distributed between 1 and 4 Hz, providing a passive suppression of motion along 
the optical axis of $10^-7$ at 10\,Hz, and going down as the frequency to the eighth power.

A similar chain of masses, called the reaction chain, hangs parallel to the main one, 
and supports the sensors and actuators used for local damping and active alignment 
of the lowermost three masses of the main chain; this provides a quiet reference point 
for the control forces. The top masses of both chains are instead actuated using the 
suspension structure as a reference. For all stages except the lowest, the sensors/actuators 
are compact units that use shadow sensors to measure the position of, and 
electromagnets to exert forces on, permanent magnets attached to the masses. 
The last stage has no local sensors, since the position of the test mass is sensed 
by the global interferometry; the actuators consist of patterns of electrodes 
deposited on the last mass of the reaction chain, which exert electrostatic 
forces on the test mass when polarized. This avoids the need of 
attaching magnet or any other part to the TM, thus maintaining low mechanical 
losses and reducing possible couplings to external fields.

Each quad suspension is attached to an in-vacuum seismic isolation platform, 
used for further suppression of ground vibrations and precise positioning and 
alignment with a larger range than allowed by the suspensions themselves. The 
platforms are six-axis, with two-stage active and passive isolators proving more 
than 3 orders of magnitude isolation above 1\,Hz, and positioning capabilities 
with nm resolution over a range of several mm.

Similar seismic isolation platforms are used to support all the in-vacuum optics; 
the optics that are part of an optical cavity are installed by triple-pendula, while 
single-pendulum suspensions, or specialized geometries, are used to isolate 
less critical optics where necessary.

In both detectors, each of the in-vacuum seismic isolation platforms is 
installed on beams that are decoupled from the vacuum system itself via 
flexible bellows, and supported from the outside using hydraulic actuated 
piers anchored to ground. This systems acts as a further layer of isolation 
and is used to correct macroscopic positioning correction like the one needed 
to correct for the moon tidal forces.

%Four 1-m long silica fibers, two per side, connect the test mass to an optic of the 
%same size and shape above it. The fibers are directly welded to both optics in a 
%monolithic assembly to reduce dissipation and consequently thermal noise. The 
%upper optic is then suspended by four steel wires that attach to the tip of as many 
%\textit{blade springs}, flexible metal blades providing vertical isolation. The blade 
%springs are anchored to a metal mass, which is in turn attached to the suspension 
%structure by another four wires and four blade springs.

\paragraph*{Laser}
At frequencies above about ??? Hz, the interferometer sensitivity is limited by shot 
noise in the laser. The relative impact of the shot noise scales as the inverse of the 
square root of the power: increasing the laser power is thus a conceptually 
straightforward way of improving the sensitivity in the shot-noise limited band. 
The Advanced LIGO laser source is designed to deliver a maximum of 180\.W of 
laser power, as opposed to the 35\.W used in eLIGO. To obtain this, a the eLIGO 
laser unit is coupled to a high power laser amplifier (say more about this). The 
beam is pre-stabilized in power, using a reference photodiode, and in frequency, 
using a thermally controlled reference optical cavity, before being handed off to the Input Optic subsystem.

\paragraph*{Thermal compensation system}
Despite the stringent requirement on the optical absorption of bulk and coating 
material of the optics, the high power levels circulating in the interferometer result 
in a non-negligible amount of heat released into the optics. Due to the poor heat 
conduction in vacuum, this induces important thermal gradients that can modify 
the optical parameters of the system via two main effects: thermal lensing in the 
bulk material, due to the temperature dependence of the index of refraction  
and surface distortion. 

\paragraph*{Optical layout}
The optical layout of Advanced LIGO is different from the initial LIGO layout in several ways. 
Perhaps the most fundamental change to the optical layout is the addition of a signal recycling 
mirror between the anti-symmetric side of the beam splitter and the optical detection port. 
In its current configuration this oft-called signal recycling mirror is actually tuned such as to 
increase the bandwidth of the detector, rather than increasing the quantum noise-limited sensitivity
in a narrow band as the name \emph{recycling} implies. As such, a more apposite name for this mirror 
in the current configuration is signal \emph{extraction} mirror. 

The signal extraction mirror forms a new cavity within Advanced LIGO; the signal recycling cavity. 
Both the signal recycling cavity and the power recycling cavity in Advanced LIGO are designed to be 
geometrically \emph{stable}, by which it should be understood that the round-trip Gouy phase in the cavity 
is significant, and thus higher-order spatial modes are non-degenerate~\cite{Arain2008}. 
This is contrast to the power recycling cavity in initial LIGO, which was only marginally stable. 
The advantages of the stable recycling cavity design have been clear during the commissioning of 
Advanced LIGO, where commissioning of the length and alignment sensing and control systems has 
been a much smoother process than in initial LIGO. (More Tangible advantages of stable recycling cavities). 

Another important geometric change to the optical layout between initial LIGO and Advanced LIGO is 
in the arm cavities. There was a drive towards using larger beam spot sizes on the mirrors in Advanced 
LIGO in order to mitigate the effects of thermal noise. In general there are two cavity geometry solutions available 
that will give a specific beam spot size on the mirrors for a two-mirror cavity of fixed length. The initial LIGO 
arm cavities were designed with a large beam waist inside the cavities, resulting in a cavity g-factor of XXX. 
Advanced LIGO uses the alternative solution of having a small beam waist size in the cavities, giving a cavity g-factor of XXX. 
The major advantage to the small beam waist size solution is that thermal deformations of the test masses caused by 
absorption in the coatings push the cavity to a more stable geometry, rather than towards a less stable geometry as 
is the case for the large beam waist design. 

Several additional optical subsystems have been added in the upgrade from initial LIGO to Advanced LIGO. 
During the enhanced LIGO phase (shortly before initial LIGO went offline for the major upgrade to aLIGO) an output
mode cleaner was added at the output port. The output mode cleaner is a crucial component of the DC readout 
scheme which was first demonstrated in GEO600, and which was determined to be a more optimal solution for 
readout of the gravitational wave signal than the previously used RF heterodyne readout scheme~\cite{DCreadout}. The output mode 
cleaner subsystem was retained in the aLIGO optical layout, and takes the form of a suspended fixed spacer cavity 
with a bow tie configuration. The output mode cleaner has the essential function of removing RF sidebands and higher-order 
spatial modes from the light incident on the photodiode, thus mitigating their impact on the shot noise sensitivity. 

A great effort was made in the upgrade to Advanced LIGO to make the lock acquisition process more deterministic than 
stochastic. Part of this effort was the inclusion of the arm length stabilization (ALS) subsystem. This subsystem consists uses 
green frequency-doubled Nd:YAG beams which are phased locked to the main laser to independently control the arm cavities during 
lock acquisition of the central dual-recycled Michelson interferometer (DRMI)~\cite{Staley2014}. Once the DRMI is locked the ALS can be used 
methodically bring the arms to resonance, bringing the full interferometer to the ideal operating point.

\paragraph*{Interferometric sensing and control}
The dual-recycled Fabry-Perot Michelson interferometer that makes up aLIGO has a very narrow linear range. 
The practical consequence of this fact, combined with the fact that even with the advanced seismic isolation systems typical 
mirror motions at low frequencies can be of the order several wavelengths, is that length control loops are essential in order 
to keep the interferometer within the linear range. 

The length sensing of all interferometric ground-based GW detectors is based on the Pound-Drever-Hall (PDH) laser 
frequency stabilization scheme~\cite{PDH}. 
In this scheme an electro-optic modulator is used to add to the main laser frequency RF phase modulation sidebands, 
which are typically non-resonant in an optical cavity when the carrier light is resonant.
When the carrier light frequency is brought close to resonance in the cavity, 
the carrier picks up a phase shift in reflection of the cavity which is proportional to the difference between carrier light 
frequency and the cavity resonant frequency. The sidebands act as a phase reference for comparison with the 
carrier light, and the reflected light 
from the cavity is detected with a photodetector and demodulated at the original modulation frequency to give an error 
signal for either the cavity length control or the laser frequency control. 

While the PDH scheme described above describes the sensing of just one length (or frequency) degree of freedom, 
the core interferometers of 2nd generation ground-based GW detectors require 5 distinct length degrees of freedom to 
be sensed and controlled. Typically these degrees of freedom are broken down into the following list: common arm length, 
differential arm length (where the GW signal predominantly appears), Michelson tuning, power recycling cavity length and 
signal recycling cavity length. In reality at least two additional degrees of freedom must be controlled; one each for the input 
and output mode cleaner cavities. This presents a formidable challenge, which was solved for Advanced LIGO by the use of two 
different modulation frequencies, at roughly 9\,MHz and 45\,MHz. The 9\,MHz sidebands are resonant in the power recycling 
cavity only, and experience a dark Michelson fringe. Detectors at various ports demodulated at this frequency typically provide 
good length sensing signals for the arm degrees of freedom, as well as the power recycling cavity length. The 45\,MHz sidebands 
are resonant in both power and signal recycling cavities, and experience a bright Michelson fringe. As a result, the detectors demodulated 
at 45\,MHz provide good sensitivity to signal recycling cavity length.

The alignment of optics must also be sensed and controlled in GW detectors. In aLIGO the sensing is currently achieved using a method 
called Wavefront Sensing, developed by Henry Ward and colleagues~\cite{Morrison1994, Morrison1994b}. 
This method is similar in principle to the PDH length sensing, 
except that quadrant photodectors are used 
instead of single-element photodetectors in order to measure the beats between sidebands and carrier in different spatial modes. An 
alternative method developed by Dana Anderson was used in Virgo, whereby the sideband frequencies were chosen such that higher-order 
spatial modes of the sidebands would be co-resonant in some of the optical cavities with the carrier fundamental mode~\cite{Anderson1984}. 
Somehow crowbar in a reference to~\cite{Fritschel1998}.
